# Hangman

This is the version of the classic letter guessing game called Hangman developed in Python. You are shown a set of blank letters that match a word or phrase and you must correctly guess these letters to reveal the hidden word.

You will learn to work with dictionaries, lists, conditionals. You'll also learn how to work with strings and occasional Python modules.
