# Python

The best way to learn a new programming language is to build projects.

A list of Python projects will be stored in this repository.

Build the project again, but with your own style. Experiment by adding new features or using different methods.

This will help you to consolidate the concepts and continue learning.

You can click on any of the projects listed below to go directly to the section of each one.
